      <h2>Business Question</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to understand how an e-commerce business is performing across revenue, repeat
        purchasing, and fulfillment efficiency. I wanted to answer questions such as: Which customers drive the most
        value? How often do customers return? Where are there bottlenecks in the order and shipping process?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data &amp; Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        I started with a raw e-commerce dataset containing orders, customers, products, and shipping details. I cleaned
        and standardized the data, then designed a relational schema and loaded everything into a SQLite database
        using SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core tables included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Customers</strong> – customer profiles and regions</li>
        <li><strong>Orders</strong> – order dates, revenue, and status</li>
        <li><strong>Order Items</strong> – product-level line items</li>
        <li><strong>Shipments</strong> – shipping times and fulfillment details</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

       <div class="section">
      <h2>Analysis &amp; KPIs</h2>
      <p>
        Using SQL, I calculated and explored a series of metrics to understand performance, then brought the most
        important ones into Power BI as KPIs and visuals:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revenue by product category and region</li>
        <li>Total orders and revenue over time</li>
        <li>Customer order frequency and repeat behavior from SQL queries</li>
        <li>Fulfillment and shipping time across order statuses and regions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These metrics were then visualized in Power BI to make trends, seasonality, and bottlenecks easy to interpret.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A small segment of repeat customers contributed a disproportionately high share of total revenue, suggesting
          an opportunity for targeted loyalty or retention campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain product categories showed strong revenue but lower repeat behavior, indicating potential issues with
          product quality, pricing, or expectations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Orders from specific regions consistently experienced longer fulfillment times, pointing to logistics or
          warehouse constraints in those areas.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates my ability to design a database from raw data, write SQL to generate meaningful KPIs,
        and turn those into clear operational insights for an e-commerce business. It mirrors the type of performance
        reporting and process-improvement analysis I’d deliver in an operations or business analyst role.
