      <h2>Question</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to understand long-term NFL team performance through win rates and scoring trends.
        I wanted to answer questions like: How do home and away win rates differ by team? Which teams historically
        overperform as favorites or underdogs? Are there clear patterns in margin of victory over time?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Data &amp; Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        I worked with a historical NFL dataset containing game-level results by team and season. Using Python and Pandas,
        I cleaned and reshaped the data to a team–season structure and then loaded it into a SQLite database for querying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main fields included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Team, opponent, season, and game location (home/away/neutral)</li>
        <li>Final scores and margin of victory</li>
        <li>Favorite/underdog indicator and closing spread</li>
        <li>Game result (win/loss/push)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Analysis &amp; Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Using SQL and Python, I engineered metrics at the team level to evaluate historical performance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Total games played by team and season</li>
        <li>Home win rate vs. away win rate</li>
        <li>Favorite win rate and underdog win rate</li>
        <li>Average and total margin of victory</li>
        <li>Seasonal trends in home/away performance over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These metrics were then brought into Power BI to build interactive dashboards
        with slicers for team and season.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Several teams exhibited strong long-term home-field advantage, with home win rates significantly higher than
          away win rates, while others were more balanced or even performed better on the road.
        </li>
        <li>
          Favorite and underdog win rates varied meaningfully by franchise, highlighting teams that historically
          outperformed expectations as underdogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Margin-of-victory trends over time showed periods of dominance and decline for specific teams, helping
          contextualize how a franchise’s performance has changed across eras.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrates my ability to clean and model sports data, engineer performance metrics, and build
        dashboards that surface meaningful trends for decision-making. The same approach can apply to betting strategy,
        team analysis, or internal reporting for sports organizations.
